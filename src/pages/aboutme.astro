      name is Ido and I am a self-proclaimed tech-nerd and lover of all things
      innovative. Based in Israel, I have been fascinated with technology from a
      young age and my passion has only continued to grow.

          I am a lifelong learner, with a love for science and an insatiable
          curiosity about how things work. This drive led me to complete an
          intensive full-stack bootcamp at <a

            href="https://www.itc.tech/">ITC</a
          > (Israel Tech Challenge), where I honed my skills in coding and
          software development, and have since been working as a dev team
          manager at Partner, Israel for the past 4 years. My expertise in the
          telephony field and strong problem-solving skills have allowed me to
          effectively lead my team and bring innovative solutions to the table.

      But what sets me apart from your average developer is my eclectic mix of
      interests and hobbies. I have a deep love for photography and even had the
      privilege of turning my passion into a business as an independent studio
      owner. In addition, I have studied 3D modeling and animation, fueling my
      secret dream of one day creating my own video game. I am also an avid
      gamer, movie buff, and tech enthusiast, always keeping up with the latest
      advancements in the industry. These diverse pursuits add depth to my
      perspective and allow me to approach problem-solving from a unique angle.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="my-5">
      I am now eager to bring my passion for development and love for all things
      tech to a new company, where I can continue growing as a developer and
      making a positive impact. Whether I'm snapping the perfect shot, creating
      a virtual world, or finding new ways to use technology for good, I am
      always on the lookout for the next adventure and eager to learn and grow
      along the way.
